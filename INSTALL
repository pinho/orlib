To install the library in your computer, you should compile it from source
code. Make sure that you is in the root directory of this repo and...

Create a directory for build files. This step is just not to "dirty" the root
directory. Types:

$ mkdir build && cd build

This project uses CMake for building. Uses the config in CMakeLists.txt placed
in root directory...

$ cmake ..

finally, to copy the headers to default installation folder in your computer
uses make install (this step requires superuser permission).

# make install
or
$ sudo make install

The headers will be copied to /usr/local/include/ on your Linux.
To choose the installation directory (where you want to copy the headers), use
the flag -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/folder/to/copy/headers/ in CMake step.
